pypp-big-inventory-gui=Increases the size of the inventory GUI to fit more recipe icons. Works well with "flat" GUI mode.
pypp-compactified-recipe-tooltips=Makes recipe tooltips take up less screen space by removing redundant information in the "made-in" section. If a recipe is made in multiple tiers of the same machine, only the first machine tier is shown.
pypp-extended-recipe-signals=Adds recipe signals to combinators to allow for dynamic recipe switching and adds text indicating the main product yield to the name of many recipes. Causes several unnecessary duplicated signals.
pypp-no-globals=Prints a warning when writing to an undocumented global variable or accessing one that's not defined. In the future this will be on by default and crash the game.
pypp-click-lock-duration=Duration of the lockout in seconds.\nIncrease the value if you see accidental clicks right after opening a menu.

[command-help]
check-technology-consistency=Checks technologies against their prototypes to ensure they aren't improperly hidden or disabled.\nThis should only be used if you're encountering deadlocks from seemingly orphaned technologies.
