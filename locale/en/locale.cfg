pypp-verbose-logging=Generates detailed logs for debugging dependency errors
pypp-big-inventory-gui=Increases the size of the inventory GUI to fit more recipe icons. Works well with "flat" GUI mode.
pypp-compactified-recipe-tooltips=Makes recipe tooltips take up less screen space by removing redundant information in the "made-in" section. If a recipe is made in multiple tiers of the same machine, only the first machine tier is shown.
pypp-extended-recipe-signals=Adds recipe signals to combinators to allow for dynamic recipe switching and adds text indicating the main product yield to the name of many recipes. Causes several unnecessary duplicated signals.
